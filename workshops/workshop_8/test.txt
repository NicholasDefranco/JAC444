This is to test Task2.Notice how some sentences have capitol T for this and some with a lowercase t
This assignment had 2tasks.
This -is a part of a sentence(or is it?)and then[possibly]the end. Another sentence with a space after the last dot.
Notice the dash just before "is"(previous line), is NOT considered a word
we use{braces}to create a block
this,is,a,list;more stuff:even more stuff.
