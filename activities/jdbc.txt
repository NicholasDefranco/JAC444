The JDBC API allows for performing any operation on any Relational Database
Management System. To interface with a database, it’s associating JDBC driver
class must be used. The client must provide a location of the database (using
the Driver’s getConnection() method) to obtain a Connection object. The
Connection object can be used to create a Statement object (by invoking
Connection’s createStatement() method) used to execute SQL statements by
passing it as a String to the Statement’s methods. Statements that query the
database return the data within a table which can be accessed similar to that
of using iterators with collections.
