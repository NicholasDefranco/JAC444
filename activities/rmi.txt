RMI allows transmitting of information similar to sockets with the addition of
interacting with objects residing on another machine. Objects a machine wishes
to be accessible must be defined by a class implementing an interface declaring
methods to be available for object interaction. This interface then implements
the java.rmi.Remote interface. An object of this type is listed with a name to
associate it with on a remotely accessible list. Other machines communicate
with the providing machine for retrieval of the object through searching the
provided list by name. Special wrapper objects are used to process requests
and responses.
